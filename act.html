<h2>🧃 We’re Generation Fix-It — Not Generation Toss-It</h2>
    <p>Fast fashion. Fast food. Fast everything. We’re living in a throwaway world that moves too fast and cares too little. <br>
Being “eco” doesn’t mean living in a mud hut with no WiFi. It means making choices that give the planet — and us — a shot at the future. It means caring loudly, not quietly. And it starts right here, right now, with you.</p>
<h2>💥 You’re Not Too Small to Make a Big Impact</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever thought, “But what can I do? I’m just one person,” read that again. Literally every movement started with one person. Trash isn’t just a physical problem — it’s a mindset. And mindsets can shift like trends. What if reusing was as cool as the latest drop? </p>
<p><span class="highlight">We’re not asking you to change the world in a day. Just start with one habit. One friend. One post. That’s how we change culture — and culture changes everything.</span></p>
